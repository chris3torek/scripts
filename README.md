This is a subset of various scripts I use (or used to use) on BSD
and Linux systems, from one-liner shell scripts to nontrivial
python programs, that I deemed suitable for publication.

I have since augmented it with various dot-files with personal
preferences, plus a script to set them up, for use on various
systems, especially for use with MAAS (Metal As A Service)
nodes (see https://docs.ubuntu.com/maas/2.2/en/).
