# _makepath is a helper subroutine for setpathwith below.
#
# We can do this to avoid cluttering up $PATH with directories
# that do not exist, at the cost of having to re-set path if
# the directories get created.  Provide a setpathwith function for
# the latter, and allow it to take arguments that it adds to
# the standard path.

	# Explanation of $accum: we're discarding duplicates in the
	# path, using the built in "case" construct.  We forbid:
	#
	#  empty strings (use "." instead)
	#  colons (forbiddin in $PATH anyway)
	#  any of these shell metacharacters: *?[|
	#
	# The last four are because they mean something in case
	# statements and will break the code below, as well as
	# because they're probably evil in $PATH anyway.

		*'*'*|*'['*|*'?'*|*'|'*)
			echo "WARNING: discarding bad path component $i" >&2
			continue;;

		# Now add the directory if and only if it exists,
		# but discarding duplicates.  Here, $accum holds a
		# pattern suitable for `case ":$i:"`.  But we must
		# "eval" to activate the shell metacharacters in $accum.
